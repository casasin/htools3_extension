Overview
--------

hTools3 dialogs are organized around common patterns or scopes in font production tasks:

- :doc:`Glyphs <glyphs/index>`: applying actions to selected glyphs in the current font
- :doc:`Font <font/index>`: applying font-level actions to a font
- :doc:`Batch <batch/index>`: applying an action to several fonts at once
- :doc:`Proof <proof/index>`: generating different kinds of proofs for the current font

Single dialogs are created using object inheritance. All dialogs inherit from the :class:`hDialog` class, which defines the basic look’n’feel and generic functionality. *Batch* and *Glyphs* dialogs inherit from higher-level :doc:`BatchDialogBase <batch/base>` and :doc:`GlyphsDialogBase <glyphs/base>` classes.

- :doc:`Misc <misc/index>`: widgets and components for use in hTools3 dialogs.
