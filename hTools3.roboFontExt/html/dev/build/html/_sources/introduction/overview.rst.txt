Toolsets
--------

hTools3 is a *modular* toolkit, with tools organized into sets. Each set corresponds to a particular scope or action pattern.

batch
^^^^^

Tools in this set apply actions to a list of closed and/or open fonts. Different batch tools use different action patterns – some tools modify fonts, some tools copy data between fonts, some tools import data from external files into fonts, etc.

Batch tools are very fast and ideal for large families and large scale ‘industrial’ font production projects.

font
^^^^

Tools in this set apply actions to font-level data in the current font. For example: font info, kerning, groups, font guidelines, etc.

glyphs
^^^^^^

Tools in this set apply actions to the selected glyphs in the `Font Overview`_ and/or to the current glyph in the `Glyph Editor`_. Actions are applied to the default layer (or the current layer in the Glyph Editor) by default. Individual layers and data types can be referenced using separate *layers* and *glyph data* modifier panels.

This toolset is the largest one in hTools3. To make options more accessible, the *glyphs* menu is divided into submenus – based on which type of data they modify or which type of action they perform. For example: anchors, contours, components, guidelines, interpolation, layers, mark color, etc.

glyph
^^^^^

Tools in this set activate visualizations and transform the current glyph in the Glyph Editor.

proofing
^^^^^^^^

Tools in this set generate font proofs of different kinds.

Interface
---------

All tools are available from a single *hTools3* entry in the main RoboFont menu. Each toolset is available from a separate submenu.

Extensions
----------

hTools3 is organized as a core extension which contains the most essential tools and modules, and a few other optional extensions which provide additional tools for other scopes.
